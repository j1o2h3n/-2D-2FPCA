Matlab realization of finger vein recognition algorithm based on (2D)^2FPCA

## About (2D)^2FPCA

Two-way Two-Dimensional Fisher Principal Component Analysis ((2D)^2FPCA) is an improved version of dimensionality reduction algorithm in machine learning.
By combining PCA and FLD algorithms, the purpose of dimensionality reduction is achieved.
